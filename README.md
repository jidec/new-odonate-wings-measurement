# new-odonate-wings-measurement
 
A simple approach to measuring odonate wing length and width that uses an adaptive threshold to remove wings from background then takes the length and width of an ellipse fit around each wing using image scale bars for accurate measurement.

It operates on folders of images where each folder has the wings in approximately the same location in the image and has identical scale bar properties.
